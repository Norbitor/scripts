## License and Contribution
All my work here is licensed under GNU GPL v3.0 license. Feel free to use it

is valid and will work on your system. So, if you'll brake something please
don't blame me, as you have been warned :-).

If you want to add something from you, do not hesitate to fork this repo and add
your changes. All pull requests are appreciated.
